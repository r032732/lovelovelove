      <p>
        happy fourth monthsarry to us, my baby.
i’m not really prepared this month because lots of stuffs happened, but i won’t let this month pass without giving you something special to remember it by. i have been thinking of stuffs that i could gift you, i thought of having stuffs delivered to you but that would be expensive asf 😭 so i came up with an alternative idea, that i would just write a very long sweet message for you. so for this month, let’s have a recap of all our memories tgt.

remember when we first talked and we were still awkward towards each other 😭 i really found your avatar cute even when i’m terrified of hello kitty and i was so friggin shy to turn on vc cause u js sound so good while me 👹👹👹.

the distance 😞 but no matter the distance, i’ll always love you. distance means nothing when the person means everything. nothing can separate us, be it the entire space, galaxy, or even time could not change my love for you. we’ll always be together in every other universe cause we are meant to be. i am made for you and you for me. no one else, just us forever, more than forever.

for my entire existence, i have never felt more loved and seen as you make me feel, and you never fail to do it consistently. i love how i never need to ask for everything i want cause you give everything i want and need, like you’re hacking my mind (maybe you are). what we have is so real that i would never exchange for anything else, even compared to all the things i love, i wouldn’t. i would always choose you and will continue to do so. being in love with you and loving you makes me feel more fulfilled than i am with all my achievements combined. that’s how much i love you, i love loving you. i never knew that there would be someone so perfect like you. are you even real? you’re too good to be true, baby, i swear. i’m so fucking glad to have met you, you’re the greatest thing that happened to me. no arguments, misunderstandings, or fights could ever change that fact. i will always fight for us, even if it means i’ll lose everything i have, just please not you. it upsets me more that no matter how hard i try to go further, to escape this place, it is never enough to go home (to go to you) :(

i hope i never lose you, i will do everything not to. i promise to take care of you, i will always stand by you, make you feel safe, and always support you wherever. i promise to never disappear on you. i will always love you. you mean so much to me that words aren’t enough to even explain.
